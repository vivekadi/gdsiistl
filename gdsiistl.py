"""
This program converts a GDSII 2D layout file to multiple 3D STL files that can
be visualized in an external program (e.g., Blender).

USAGE:
    - edit the "layerstack" variable in the "CONFIGURATION" section below
    - run "gdsiistl file.gds"
OUTPUT:
    - the files file.gds_layername1.stl, file.gds_layername2.stl, ...

The program takes one argument, a path to a GDSII file. It reads shapes from
each layer of the GDSII file, converts them to polygon boundaries, then makes
a triangle mesh for each GDSII layer by extruding the polygons to given sizes.

All units, including the units of the exported file, are the GDSII file's
user units (often microns).

First, a list of vertices, as before. Second, a dictionary with triangulation
information: the 'vertices' element contains vertex information stored the
same way as the main polygon vertices, and the 'triangles' element is a list
of which vertices correspond to which triangle (in counterclockwise order).
Third and finally, a boolean value that indicates whether the polygon was
defined clockwise (so that the STL triangles are oriented correctly).
